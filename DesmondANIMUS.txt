Open Source is love, Open Source is life. Why did I make such a bold statement? Well that's because it is
actually something I fantasize about. A community of people helping out each-other, learning and growing
together. I cannot mention that just how many times Open Source community helped me out when I got stuck 
in projects. 

I have seen some awesome projects out there and they encourage me to become better so that I can help other 
people like me in order to achieve a greater goal and that being.... making the world a better place :)
